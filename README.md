## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

| Technology | Purpose |
|------------|---------|
| **FastAPI** | Web framework for building APIs |
| **SQLModel** | Database ORM and data validation |
| **SQLite** | Database (easily replaceable) |
| **JWT** | Authentication tokens |

## Installation

1. **Clone or navigate to the project directory**:
   ```bash
   cd uni-mangment-sys
   ```

2. **Create and activate a virtual environment**:
   ```bash
   python -m venv .venv
   # On Windows
   .venv\Scripts\activate
   # On macOS/Linux
   source .venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Set up environment variables**:
   - Copy the `.env` file and modify the `SECRET_KEY` for production use
   - Update database settings if needed

5. **Initialize the database with sample data**:
   ```bash
   python init_db.py
   ```

## Running the Application

1. **Start the FastAPI server**:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
   Or using uvicorn directly:
   ```bash
   uvicorn main:app --reload
   ```

2. **Access the application**:
   - API: http://localhost:8000
   - Interactive API Documentation: http://localhost:8000/docs
   - Alternative API Documentation: http://localhost:8000/redoc

## Authentication

To access protected endpoints:

1. Login using the `/auth/login` endpoint
2. Copy the returned access token
3. Include it in the Authorization header: `Bearer <your_token>`

## Database Schema

The system includes the following main entities:

- **Users**: Base user information with roles
- **Students**: Student-specific information linked to users
- **Instructors**: Instructor-specific information linked to users
- **Courses**: Course information with instructor assignments
- **Enrollments**: Student-course relationships with status and grades

## Configuration

Environment variables (in `.env` file):

- `DATABASE_URL`: Database connection string
- `SECRET_KEY`: JWT secret key (change in production!)
- `ALGORITHM`: JWT algorithm (default: HS256)
- `ACCESS_TOKEN_EXPIRE_MINUTES`: Token expiration time
